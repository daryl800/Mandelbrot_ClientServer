# Mandelbrot_ClientServer

### This project has two applications:  Server part and client part, which together renders parts of the Mandelbort set.  
1.  Server application accepts requests on a TCP port.
2.  Client application spreads the workload over a set of severs.

# Getting Started

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prerequisites
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java runtime environment (ideally latest version) is needed.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setup & Installation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All *.class files should be placed in the same directory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the java/classs files, there additional files must exist (or created) in the same working diretory, namely:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. users.csv contains username and password and must be setup and edited by the adminstrator before executing the program.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. projects.csv contains project details.  Projects details must be edited accroding to the format specified in the first comment line (preceed by a # sign).  The idea is that this projects.csv file will be replaced a by database.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. taskObject.txt contains the detailed information of the tasks in the object form.  This file will be automatically created by the program and should never be editied or removed.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execution 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;javac Run
